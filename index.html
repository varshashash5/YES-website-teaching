  <p>We took a few steps to calculate our reflectance percentage from our data from the spectrometer.</p>
  <p>1. We had a purple folder and white paper. To calibrate our spectrometer, we first found the wavelength values for all colors while the spectrometer was on the white paper, and the measure with no color buttons pressed at all for the dark voltage value.</p>

<p>Here is this graph that we made: </p>
